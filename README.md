Segmented anisotropic ssTEM dataset of neural tissue
----------------------------------------------------

The ground truth stack 1 contains 20 sections from serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) of the Drosophila melanogaster third instar larva ventral nerve cord. The cube measures 4.7 x 4.7 x 1 microns approx, with a resolution of 4.6 x 4.6 nm/pixel and section thickness of 45-50 nm.

### The challenge
Use *stack 1* to train pixel classifiers for the purpose of automatic segmentation of neural structures in ssTEM. For instance, use 80% of the sections to train, and 20% of the sections for validation. Apply the classifier to the raw data of *stack 2* (test data) and send us the results, so we're able to compute pixel-wise and other error measures in the subsequent neuron reconstruction pipeline.
